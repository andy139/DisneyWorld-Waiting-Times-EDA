In this project we analyzed waiting times at Disney World. Our project is divided into two different IPython notebooks. The first notebook containing our exploratory data analysis, and the second containing our predictions on the data using different machine learning models.

The data is obtained from the official Disney World tour website. It consists of features such as max temperature, and percentage of kids in school in a given day.
