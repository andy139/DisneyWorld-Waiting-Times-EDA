# Disney World Waiting Times Analysis
This project was created as a final project for our Statistical Data Science Class that goes over the fundamentals of utilizing IPython for data science, while we use the sklearn package to develop machine learning models. Our project is divided into two different IPython notebooks. The first notebook containing our exploratory data analysis, and the second containing our predictions on the data using different machine learning models.
